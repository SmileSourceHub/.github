# Rules of the GitHub Organization for Agile Team Development

## Purpose of the Organization
The GitHub organization aims to encourage the creation and development of computer projects using agile methodologies, while promoting collaboration among teams of 3 to 9 individuals.

## Membership in the Organization
Anyone sharing an interest in agile development and team collaboration can join the GitHub organization, provided they adhere to the principles and agile rules outlined below.

## Project Creation
Organization members are encouraged to propose projects based on agile principles. Each project should include a concise description, an initial product backlog, and a draft of planned iterations.

## Team Size
Project teams must consist of a minimum of 3 members and a maximum of 9 members, in line with agile values of effective communication and close collaboration.

## Agile Methodology
Each project must adopt an agile methodology, such as Scrum, Kanban, or XP. Teams are free to choose the methodology that best suits their project, while ensuring adherence to fundamental agile principles.

## Iterations and Planning
Projects must be organized into reasonable-duration iterations (sprints), with clear goals for each iteration. Teams should hold planning, review, and retrospective meetings at the end of each iteration.

## Active Participation
Each team member must actively participate in agile ceremonies, follow-up meetings, and project-related discussions. Regular contribution and transparent communication are essential.

## Product Backlog
Each project must maintain an up-to-date product backlog, comprising prioritized work items based on business value. Members can submit new ideas to enrich the backlog.

## Transparency
Teams must maintain transparency regarding project status, encountered obstacles, and decisions made. Kanban or Scrum boards are recommended for visually tracking progress.

## Collaboration and Self-Organization
Teams are encouraged to work autonomously and make collective decisions. Collaboration, open communication, and adaptability are crucial for success in an agile environment.

## Continuous Feedback
Members commit to providing and receiving constructive feedback with a spirit of continuous improvement. Project enhancements should be made iteration after iteration, based on received feedback.

## Learning and Adaptation
The organization promotes a culture of continuous learning and adaptation. Members are encouraged to explore new practices and adjust their approach based on lessons learned.

By adopting these rules based on agility, the GitHub organization aims to create an environment conducive to creation, collaboration, and innovation while respecting the core principles of agile development.
